# Mind-Map
GIven a board of size nXn (always assume an even-square board, 2x2 or 4x4 etc,) Each card in the board corresponds to one character. The board will contain its pair in a different position. Eg: the board should have two Batman, one at position (1,1) and the other at (2x3) in a square board. Now letâ€™s get to the game part of it. Rules to stick: 1. No character should occur more than twice. So, in a 4x4 board, a total of 8 characters should be present, 2. All characters should be closed first 3. Any character can be chosen by the user using its coordinates 4. The character should be kept open until the next move is made. Once made, keep it revealed if both the coordinates are pointing to the same character, else close both the cards. Game ends when any of the following conditions are met: 1. All matching characters are revealed 2. When a specific card gets revealed more than 4 times
